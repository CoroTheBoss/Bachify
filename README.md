# Bachify

**Bachify** is an AI-powered tool designed to harmonize melodies in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach's chorales. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to generate polyphonic harmonizations, capturing the intricate harmonic richness characteristic of Bach's compositions.

Given a Soprano melody as input, Bachify predicts the accompanying parts—Alto, Tenor, and Bass—creating a complete four-part chorale. The model has been trained on a dataset of Bach's chorales, allowing it to generate harmonizations that adhere to classical voice-leading rules and stylistic nuances.

Whether you're a music enthusiast, a student of music theory, or a developer with an interest in AI and music, Bachify offers an intriguing exploration into the intersection of machine learning and classical music composition.
